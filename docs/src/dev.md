# Notes
Development philosophy:
  1. Initially do everything with rudimentary arrays (eg.: CuArrays) . Add Abstract datatypes. The idea is to make sure that the introduction of custom datatypes does not affect performance. This inevitably means that the code will be complex during the initial phase of development.
  2. Get the science right first, then performance, and finally code complexity.
  3. Docs support from day 1
  4. Write the examples first even if they don't work.
  5. Support for tests
